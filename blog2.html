    <h2>Designing for Fairness: Can AI Be Truly Ethical?</h2>
    <p>Ethics in AI isn’t just about avoiding harm—it’s about actively designing systems that promote fairness, dignity, and equity.</p>
    <p>Most AI systems are built with performance metrics like speed, accuracy, and scalability. But ethical design asks different questions: Who benefits from this system? Who might be excluded? What unintended consequences could arise?</p>
    <p>Consider predictive policing tools. They aim to allocate law enforcement resources efficiently, but often rely on crime data that’s shaped by decades of over-policing in marginalized communities. The result? A feedback loop that reinforces systemic injustice.</p>
    <p>Ethical AI design means embedding values into every stage of development—from data collection to model training to deployment. It means involving ethicists, sociologists, and affected communities in the design process. It also means being transparent about limitations and trade-offs.</p>
    <p>We must also rethink what success looks like. Instead of optimizing for profit or speed, we should measure impact on equity, inclusion, and long-term social outcomes. Ethical design is not a luxury—it’s a necessity.</p>
    <p>True fairness in AI isn’t a checkbox—it’s a commitment. And it starts with asking hard questions, listening to diverse voices, and being willing to change course when the answers challenge our assumptions.</p>
