    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>BiasDecoded was created to raise awareness about the hidden biases in AI systems and the ethical questions they provoke. We believe that understanding these biases is the first step toward building fairer, more transparent technologies.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>AI is increasingly used to make decisions that affect people’s lives—from hiring and lending to policing and healthcare. If the data it learns from is biased, those decisions can be unjust. BiasDecoded aims to make these issues visible and understandable for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>This site is maintained by a team of curious minds passionate about ethical tech. Whether you're a student, developer, policymaker, or simply AI-curious, you're welcome here. We’re committed to making complex ideas accessible and actionable.</p>

    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    <p>If you’d like to contribute, suggest resources, or collaborate, feel free to reach out via our contact page (coming soon). Together, we can decode bias and build better systems.</p>
