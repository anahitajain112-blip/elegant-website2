      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p><strong>BiasDecoded</strong> was created to raise awareness about the hidden biases in AI systems and the ethical questions they provoke. We believe that understanding these biases is the first step toward building fairer, more transparent technologies.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>AI is increasingly used to make decisions that affect people’s lives—from hiring and lending to policing and healthcare. If the data it learns from is biased, those decisions can be unjust. BiasDecoded aims to make these issues visible and understandable for everyone.</p>
